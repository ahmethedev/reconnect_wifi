# Shell scripts for reconnecting Wifi when it is distrupted.

My collage wifi connection is not stable so I needed to connect again everytime when Wifi connection is lost. So I wrote a shell script that automaticly connect to the wifi everytime when connection is lost.

# How to use?

2- Make the script executable by running the following command:
    chmod +x reconnect_wifi.sh
3- Run the scipt: 
    ./reconnect_wifi.sh
